First draft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QDQJKL8Mu3Wiylm2HqbXMd1_wGZSbm0dm4QZVeJyYQ/edit?usp=sharing

### Nov 7
Meeting with Dr. Hayashi.
1. Data: 
	Weâ€™ll first work on library photos. Then try to generalize the program to classify iPhone photos. Data is preferably stored in Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Amazon cloud can be a backup choice. After we decide the place to store, we will create an interface for uploading the data (also sharing the data among contributors).

2. Program:
	We can try to build other image classification program using other datasets, so that when our retina data is ready, we just need to make some adjustment.
